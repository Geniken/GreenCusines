# GreenThumb-Cuisines


GreenThumb Cuisines is an iOS app that uses the Edamam API to promote users to make healthier dietary choices. It is written in Swift 3. 

# Idea

Finding a healthy way to eat while keeping your palate satisfied is hard as healthy foods or recipes stereotypically seem to be less flavorful than their unhealthier counterparts. GreenThumb Cuisines is able to compile the user a comprehensive list based on the user's search term whether is a recipe or a specific ingredient.
