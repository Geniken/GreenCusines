# GreenThumb-Cuisines

The purpose of this application is to help people make smarter health choices related to their eating habits. 
GreenThumb Cuisine encourages users to search recipes or food groups to get a comprehensive list of options that the user can indulge in. 
I am currently working on integrating dietary labels such as high-fiber, low-fat, etc to help the user filter out the foods or recipes
that they believe conflicts with their ideal diets.
